# SQLite Task Manager

Let's build a Task class capable of CRUD against a SQL table tasks.

You are given a `tasks.db` database with one task (`id = 1`), a `task.rb` file to complete and a `test.rb` to test your code.

1. Implement the **READ** logic to `find` a given task (by its `id`)
2. Implement the **CREATE** logic in a `save` instance method
3. Implement the **UPDATE** logic in the same method
4. Implement the **READ** logic to retrieve `all` tasks (what type of method is it?)
5. Implement the **DESTROY** logic on a task
